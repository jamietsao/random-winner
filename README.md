# random-winner
After receiving a $100 gift card to DoorDash for taking a sales call with one of our software vendors, I decided to give it to someone random on the team.  I wrote a quick program to select the winner.

# Drumroll, please ... 🥁🥁🥁🥁
This was the result:
```
➜  random go run main.go

     Benny => 1250893
   Brandon => 1249641
      Andy => 1250759

   Leilani => 1250984
      Jeff => 1248989
      Bigo => 1251376
    Carmen => 1248813

The winner is .......
