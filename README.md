# random-winner
After receiving a $100 gift card to DoorDash for taking a sales call with a software vendor, I decided to give it to someone random on the team.  I wrote a quick program to select the winner 🤓.

## UPDATE - 1/26/21
After reading this wonderful [post](https://www.lihaoyi.com/post/BuildyourownCommandLinewithANSIescapecodes.html) about [ANSI escape codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code), this silly program I wrote a few months back was the perfect opportunity to dabble with them.  So instead of immediately displaying the final results with an anti-climatic drumroll (see original version below), I used ANSI escape codes to simulate a dramatic race to the finish line.

Here was the original version:

Tada!

## Original Version (run on 8/4/20)
### Drumroll, please ... 🥁🥁🥁🥁
This was the result:

   Brandon => 1249641
      Andy => 1250759

The winner is .......
